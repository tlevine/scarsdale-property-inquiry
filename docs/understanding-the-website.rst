Using Scarsdale's property inquiry website
=============================================
Scarsdale just changed how it assesses the value of properties for
tax purposes, and they've put a lot of cool information up on the
internet in the
`property inquiry website <http://www.scarsdale.com/Home/Departments/InformationTechnology/PropertyInquiry.aspx>`_.
Here's how you use it.

Looking up particular a property
----------------------------------

Let's look up 54 Walworth Avenue, the house that I grew up in.
We look at the "Please choose a street name" section and scroll
until we find the street "WALWORTH". We click on "WALWORTH".

Then we get an unlabeled box with a bunch of street addresses.
We click on "54 WALWORTH".

This gives us back a `long webpage <54-walworth/full.png>`_
with lots of stuff on it.

webpage. This webpage is grouped into different sections.
